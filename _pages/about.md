SimBricks is a simulation framework that enables full end-to-end evaluation of
modern network systems in simulation. Our primary aim is to to enable network
systems research and instruction &mdash; from rapid prototyping to meaningful
performance evaluation.

SimBricks modularly combines and connects multiple battle-tested simulators for
different components: machines (e.g. QEMU, gem5), hardware components (e.g.
Verilator, Tofino, FEMU SSD), and networks (e.g. ns-3, OMNeT++). SimBricks
assembles multiple instances of these simulators into simulated testbeds capable
of running unmodified full system stacks, including applications and operating
systems such as Linux.
