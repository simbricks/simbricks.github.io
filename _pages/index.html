    <p>End-to-end system simulation through modular combination of component
    simulators.</p>

    <div class="textcol">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>SimBricks is a simulation framework that enables full end-to-end
      evaluation of modern network systems in simulation. Our primary aim is to
      to enable network systems research and instruction &mdash; from rapid
      prototyping to meaningful performance evaluation.</p>

      <p>SimBricks modularly combines and connects multiple battle-tested
      simulators for different components: machines (e.g. QEMU, gem5), hardware
      components (e.g.  Verilator, Tofino, FEMU SSD), and networks (e.g. ns-3,
      OMNeT++). SimBricks assembles multiple instances of these simulators into
      simulated testbeds capable of running unmodified full system stacks,
      including applications and operating systems such as Linux.</p>

        alt="Example of a SimBricks simulation configuration with three
        simulated hosts, a server and two clients. We simulate the server in
        gem5 and connect to an SSD simulated through FEMU and a Corundum FPGA
        NIC simulated through Verilator. The two clients are simulated in QEMU
        and connect to a PCIe behavioral NIC model. All three hosts are
        connected through a network simulated in ns-3."></div> </section>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="goal-endtoend"><strong>End-to-End:</strong>
        simulate full network systems, with hosts, devices, network, and the
        full software stack.
      </li>
      <li class="goal-scalable"><strong>Scalable:</strong>
        simulate large network systems comprising tens or hundreds of separate
        hosts and devices.
      </li>
      <li class="goal-fast"><strong>Fast:</strong>
        keep simulation times as low as possible.
      </li>
      <li class="goal-modular"><strong>Modular:</strong>
        enable flexible composition of simulators, where components can be added
        and swapped independently.
      </li>
      <li class="goal-accurate"><strong>Accurate:</strong>
        preserve accuracy of constituent simulators, correctly interface and
        synchronize components.
      </li>
      <li class="goal-deterministic"><strong>Deterministic:</strong>
        keep end-to-end simulation deterministic when individual simulators are
        deterministic.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="technique-interfaces">
        <h3>Fixed natural component simulator interfaces</h3>
        SimBricks defines an interface for each component type
        to enable modular composition of simulators...
      </li>
      <li class="technique-sync">
        <h3>Accurate and efficient synchronization</h3>
        SimBricks ensures accurate simulation through correct time
        synchronization, but with minimal runtime overhead...
      </li>
      <li class="technique-loose">
        <h3>Loose coupling with message passing</h3>
        SimBricks runs component simulators as separate processes that
        communicate through message passing...
      </li>
      <li class="technique-parallel">
        <h3>Parallel execution with shared memory queues</h3>
        SimBricks runs simulators in parallel on different host cores and
        connects them through optimized shared-memory queues...
