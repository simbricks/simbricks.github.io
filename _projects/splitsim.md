  Accelerate simulators by decomposing them into parallel synchronized
  components.

Accelerating simulators by parallelization is a promising approach. Yet, it is
challenging to parallelize and do it in an efficient and scalable way while
preserving timing accuracy. To this end, we present a multi-process simulation
framework SplitSim. Motivated by SimBricks, SplitSim provides a method to
systematically decompose a large instance of simulation into several pieces and
run them in parallel, while safeguarding accurate timing. Whatâ€™s more, it is
flexible in terms of deciding the number and the scope of divided pieces. We are
adopting SplitSim to several representative simulators, including ns-3 and gem5,
in the network area and computer architecture area respectively.
